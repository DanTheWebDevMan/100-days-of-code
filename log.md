# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 7: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visual Design module: Font-size, font-weight, line-height, changing an element's relative positions, locking an element to the browser window with fixed positioning,

**Thoughts** : Never knew about pseudo-classes. The term "relative" was always confusing to me- but I think I got a better understanding of it today. From my understanding, relative states how CSS changes from where it would [relatively] normally be. The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls. "position: fixed" would be good to use for navbars I want to keep in place (think excel's 'freeze top row')


### Day 6: January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Missed yesterday's coding due to new years festivities, but won't fall back off. Work on my resolutions appplication some more and started the Applied Visual Design module. Creating visual balance using the text-align property, using the width & height properties, worked on strong, underline, italicize, strikethrough tags, opacity, text transform.  

**Thoughts** : Really liking how in depth I'm getting into CSS. Never knew about box-shadow and text-transform.


### Day 5: December 31, 2019 

**Today's Progress**:  CSS Review- Using Hex Code, using !important, RGB values to color elements, CSS variables to change several elements at once, creating custom CSS variable, attaching a Fallback to CSS variables, inheriting CSS variables, media query to change a variable.

**Thoughts** : Never knew how detailed the hex coding for colors could be. Never knew about Fallback values- found this a little difficult.

### Day 4: December 30, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Covered adding rounded corners and how to make circlular borders w/ border-radius, using an id Attribute to Style an Element, adjusting the padding,margins, and borders of an element,Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element, Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements, learned about Absulute vs relative units, and overriding class declarations

**Thoughts** : Never knew about the Clockwise notation to specify the padding of an element. Never used Attribute Selectors before.


### Day 3: December 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Dove into CSS starting today. Used to creating a separate CSS file but got some practice in with in-style CSS, something I really haven't practiced before. Covered adding CSS classes, changing the font size of an element, setting the font family of an element, importing Google Font, specify how fonts should degrade, sizing images, and different border styles.

**Thoughts** : learned some more detailed HTML features, such as radio button, check button, how to have one the buttons selected by default by using "checked". 


### Day 2: December 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to add input field to form, how to add a submit button, created a set of radio buttons, how to create checkboxes, Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes, intro to divs. Completed "Introduction to HTML"

**Thoughts** : learned some more detailed HTML features, such as radio button, check button, how to have one the buttons selected by default by using "checked". 

### Day 1: December 27, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Came across the rules for 100 days of Code challenge. Was a little confused as to where to start, so started watching the "Introduction to HTML and CSS" track videos on Treehouse. Then started my first lesson in Free Code Bootcamp, "Basic HTML and HTML5: Say Hello to HTML Elements". Never hurts to get a refresher on the basics, right?

Completed 50% of lesson before calling it a night (Turn an Image Into a Link)

**Thoughts:**: Something I never knew style wise was the code to the hover feature allowing you to make an image bigger and being able to rotate it. A little stuck on where exactly to proceed next, (review classwork, read book, do more treehouse videos, etc.) but I think I'll start with the FreeCodeBootcamp online on a daily basis. Might have to cancel my Treehouse subscription and get it again at a later time.
